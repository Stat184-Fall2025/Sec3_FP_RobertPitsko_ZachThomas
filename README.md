# Exploring USDA data for Pennsylvania from 2004 - 2010

This repository contains work related to our final project for STAT184, where we use the skills learned in class to explore Pennsylvania Federal Funds data from the Department of Agriculture.

## Overview

We are using Pennsylvania spending to data in different objects, for example grants and salaries, and different functions, for example agriculture and national funding. We are tracking the data over time to see if we can spot any interesting trends or ideas that we could draw from to create a unique conclusion. We will be using ggplot to make our graphs and will be drawing the data from the USDA Federal Funds website which makes the data open source and available for analysis. 

### Interesting Insight
One interesting insight was the actual total spending on each category in the years. Its interesting to see the amount in the billions for some subjects even just for PA. When you look at it in an overview some entire country's spend in a year what we spend in a few months just in PA. 


## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

All data from USDA: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/federal-funds

## Current Plan
We will first take all of our data and upload to the combined Git (this repo), then we will split off into our own paths Zach doing the objects analysis and Robert doing the function analysis. We will use clean qmd notebooks to represent our work and then will commit everything and tidy up our git in order to effectively present our EDA and findings.
